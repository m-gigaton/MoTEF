# Near Optimal Decentralized Optimization with Compression and Momentum Tracking

Here you can find implementation of Logistic Regression and MLP experiments. Our code is based on [BEER](https://github.com/liboyue/beer/tree/master) and [NDA](https://github.com/liboyue/Network-Distributed-Algorithm) repositories.

We provide an example notebook with the code to run experiments.

The code for the synthetic problems is in ``synthetic/``

The code for symbolically verifying our choices of parameters is in ``symb-verification/``
